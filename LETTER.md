# Beginning Investing: Letter to Future Self

When investing for the first time I recommend and find it incredibly helpful to take 10 minutes to write a letter to your future self; delivered 2-3 years in the future. Writing this letter will establish and confirm your expectations around timelines and returns, focus your investment strategy on a longer time horizon, and help you avoid making reactionary investment decisions that often lead to losses.

Investing for the long term necessitates investing in companies that you believe will have long term success. Further, _growing_ as an investor necessitates reflecting on the investment decisions you made at the time where enough information is available to determine if your investment decision was correct. However, if becoming a better investor depends on evaluating previous investment decisions and those investment decisions were made 1-5 years ago, it has been my experience that I often forget the important details of _why_ I made these investment decisions in the first place. Thus, I've found documenting the rationalle for my investment decisions and delivering that information at the appropriate time for reflection to be a superpower for improving as an investor. It's my secret weapon.

For example, my wife Pam believes that a video game metaverse will be created where players can move between video games in one unified experience on a single platform. She therefore invested in the company Roblox (June, 2021) as she believes they're closest and best positioned to create this metaverse. Her rationalle for making this investment was the following: 
  - A video game metaverse will play an important role in the future of gaming. 
  - Roblox will create and popularize a metaverse.
  - People will love the metaverse, and Roblox will grow substantially.
  - Roblox will be able to monetize this metaverse in a meaningful way.
 
It won't be for 3-5 years after her initial investment (June 2021) until we see whether her investment assumptions were all correct, partially correct or incorrect. By documenting these reasons and delivering them to a timely point in the future she (we) can reflect and learn. At that time in the future we may ask ourselves: 
  - Did Roblox create a great metaverse? 
    - If they were not able to create a metaverse, why not? These reasons may be helpful to determine how other companies may fail at similar endavours and inform future investment decisions.
    - If they were able to create a metaverse, could this concept be applied to other areas outside of video games? 
  - Was Roblox able to effectively monetize the metaverse? Why or why not? ...
  - etc.

The lessons we learn from our investment decisions, both the correct and incorrect decisions, can greatly improve future decision making. Refelective thinking is a superpower; particularly in financial investing.
